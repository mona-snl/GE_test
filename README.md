The aim of this project is to create an interactive watch with various features and animations.

### In part A :

• Displays the current time

• A button “mode” allows to change time

• When pressing the “mode” button, the time is editable: the “increase” button adds one hour

• When pressing the “mode” button again, the “increase” button adds one minute

• When pressing the “mode” button a third time, the time is no more editable: the “increase” button does nothing

• The button “light” turns on the screen to be readable even at night

### In part B :

• Display multiple clocks in the page

• Each clock shall display a different time zone (ex: GMT+1, GMT+2…)

• Add a reset button to reinitialize a clock after using the edit button

• Add a button that dynamically creates and displays a new clock (extra
bonus if you can choose the time zone before creating it)

• Add a button to change the display between 24h and AM/PM format


### In part C 

• Implement a set of classes to provide:

    • 2d vector/point coordinate
    • 3x3 matrix and functions associated to it:
    • Inverse
    • Multiply
    • Transform point/vector
    • Functions to create translation/rotation/scaling matrix

• Leverage this library to animate the watch position by combining a set of
matrices:

The watch shall rotate on itself, scale up and down, and rotate around an arbitrary point (randomly defined at page load or from a user input field) 


### Final part

Merge everything together.
